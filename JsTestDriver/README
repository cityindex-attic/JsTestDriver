The version of jquery and json2 used have been slightly modified to handle
corner cases when conflicting libraries are loaded.

jQuery changes:
 - tests for alert instead of setInterval to check if an object is window
   (as the jstestdriver defines these functions) this change is probably
   unnecessary as I don't see anyone wanting to call makeArray on the
   jstestdriver object, but you never know !
 - uses the jstestdriver.set{Timeout,Interval} and
   jstestdriver.clear{Timeout,Interval} instead of the global ones

json2 changes:
 - to be compatible with prototype.js (http://www.prototypejs.org/) make sure
   that in the function str the method toJson is not called when the object is
   an array


Compatibility issues:
* Opera seems to just stop interpreting and running JavasSript when it encounters a JavaScript file
  with errors which sucks as we could just continue to run fine with the files we already have
  loaded.

* Konqueror just doesn't seem to like us at all in all sorts of ways.
