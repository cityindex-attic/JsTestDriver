1.1.0
-----

Variables set on the 'this' object within are now available within setup, teardown, and the tests themselves.

The test function now supports the optional second parameter of the expected number of assertions.

Thanks to anotherhero for this patch.

1.0.3
-----

Tests declared without a module will now run.

1.0.2
-----

Tests now run successfully when the lifecycle object exists but Setup and Teardown are undefined.
Included a new test file, and JS Test Driver config (tests of fail and error behaviour currently commented out).
New folder structure, with src and src-test directories.

1.0.1
-----

Fixed ok() assertion to behave the same as jquery (it now succeeds with anything other than 0, false, or null)
